Given than [68 million people in the United States](https://www.podcastinsights.com/podcast-statistics/) alone listen to podcasts weekly, it is a lucrative business.\n",

    "\n",
    "To answer that question, we'll be working with an iTunes database that contains over 46 000 podcasts and 1.2 million reviews. The reviews date between 2005 and 2021, which provides us with plenty of historical data. The full database can be [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thoughtvector/podcastreviews).\n",

    "To determine the best topic and theme for a potential podcasts, we’ll do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Determine what categories have the highest rating\n",
    "- Examine how that rating has changed over time\n",
    "- Look at the most popular podcast within the most popular categories to uncover any trends \n",
